# How to Add Live Reload to Your Rails Application

Live reload is an incredible tool for developers looking to boost their productivity. In this tutorial, I will walk you through the process of implementing live reload in your Ruby on Rails application using esbuild.

Implementing live reload can greatly streamline your development workflow, saving you valuable time and effort. By automatically refreshing your app whenever you make changes, you can instantly see the results without manually reloading the page.

To achieve this, we will leverage the power of esbuild, a cutting-edge technology for fast and efficient JavaScript bundling. By combining esbuild with Ruby on Rails, we can create a seamless live reload experience that will streamline your development process.
